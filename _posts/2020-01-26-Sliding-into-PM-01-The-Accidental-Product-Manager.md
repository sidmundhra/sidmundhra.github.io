*Imagine it’s your first week into a full-time job at a startup and the CEO walks in, informs you that the project you were hired for has been shelved and the only available position is that of a product manager(PM), which you don’t know anything about, so you either take that or you’d have to find a job somewhere else. Would you take it or leave it? Now, in normal circumstances, one would enquire what the job is about? What would the role entail? But this guy I interviewed last week, agreed to the PM role on the spot. And that kickstarted his Product Management career.*

[Nishant Swaroop](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishant-swaroop-55083a52/) is a current Product Manager II at Intuit and he’s spent the last 5 years working as Product Manager at multiple companies ranging from a small startup to a giant organization like Facebook (FB). He’s worked on several products over the years that you might be using every day. I got to know Nishant when I reached out to him last year for a few questions I had about the field and he was patient enough to answer all of them. So, when I announced my blog project, it was only befitting that I got him back on a call and picked his brain with more questions. He’s one of those interesting people I wish would never stop talking because of the amount of knowledge they contain and are willing to share.

The previous weekend I spoke to Nishant about his journey into product management and the lessons he’s learned along the journey so far. Here are a few key takeaways from my conversation with him:-

**SM**: Let’s talk about your college days and what field were you most interested in at that time?

**NS**: I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering in India and during this time, I got interested in the Aerospace industry and wanted to do something in that. So naturally, I came to the US to pursue my Master’s in Aerospace Engineering right after my undergrad. While pursuing my Master’s I really got into drones and although I was building drones since my undergrad but my interest actually piqued here. I entered drone-building competitions and learned a ton of stuff about drones. It was really fun.

**SM**: Wait a minute! So you never studied computer science?

**NS**: Nope. Nada.

**SM**: Then how did you end up in product management?

**NS**: After I completed my Masters, I was applying for jobs in the Aerospace industry and that’s when reality hit me. If you think getting into PM or CS roles is tough, try finding a job in the Aerospace Industry. There are so many filters and challenges present in that industry, you’re better off doing something else. To work in Aerospace, you have to get through something called the IATA or sometimes you have to be a citizen of the country. The options in aerospace are very limited. Naturally, I did not end up getting into it. Fortunately, the startup I interned at, they sent me an offer to join them as a project manager for a project they were planning to launch in the US. Literally, after a week I joined, the CEO comes into the room and tells me that the project has been shelved and there’s only one position available, that of a product manager. Now, at that point, I had no clue what a product manager does. I had no idea what a ‘scrum’ or a ‘sprint’ is. But I did not have any other offers in hand and it would be very stressful to go through the job application period again. So I said yes to it. I started learning more about the role by shadowing a few other PMs in the company. I learned the foundations of PM on the job. It was a steep learning curve. Luckily, they were working on a software that I’d used earlier so it wasn’t that bad. Hence, I always say, I am an accidental product manager. I had no plans about product management when I was studying.

**SM**: WOW! That’s an interesting way to find oneself thrown into product management. You broke into PM from a field that is a polar opposite to what everyone currently associates it with (Computer Science, for the uninitiated). What about Facebook? How did that come about?

**NS**: After a year or so at this startup, I realized I wasn’t learning a lot and had hit a plateau. I started looking at other opportunities where I could learn and grow. That’s when I came to know about Facebook’s Rotational Product Manager Program(FB RPM), where you join as a product manager and get to work on a bunch of different projects around the world through 3 rotations in 18 months. I applied and fortunately, I got an offer from them. I joined immediately and it is one of the best decisions I ever made in my career. Facebook has tons of smart people to work with. I got to work on so many different projects at FB and learned so much about various technologies. It was amazing.

**SM**: Can you expand a little on your experiences at FB as a company and how is it different than what you do now?

**NS**: Facebook has a gamut of interesting projects that they work on at any given point of time. The problems they’re trying to solve have a large-scale impact and Facebook is trying to solve a lot of them. As a company, it has a flat hierarchy and has a very open company culture. There are no set-in-stone processes that are defined at FB. Each team works with a process that works best for them and therefore there are lesser processes to follow when you are trying to launch something, which is also very effective when you seek feedback for ideas. The flat structure really works well for a company like Facebook. But at the same time, FB is a huge company, so if you’re working on something, trying to find the right person to talk to can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Hence, building a concrete knowledge base is tough.

In contrast, I currently work in FinTech which is a very process-driven field. And rightly so, because a small mistake could cost customers billions of dollars. The stakes are high, but the problems are interesting as well. At Intuit, if you’re trying to solve a problem in a specific field, you would know exactly who might be able to help you with it. Therefore, the two companies are really different in the approach that they choose in solving problems.

**SM**: What are the different projects you worked on at FB, if you’re at liberty to discuss them?

**NS**: Sure! I’ve worked on multiple projects like ads, FB search, FB growth, and FB groups. Of all the projects I worked on, the growth project was the most fun and challenging to work on. To build something from zero to one and then scaling it, it’s exciting. Identifying problems, building a hypothesis, conducting user interviews, and prototyping a solution basically provides you a crash course in product management. You realize the importance of having the right team when working on problems that impact millions of customers. I cannot stress this enough, but in any PM project, it’s vital to keep your users’ needs in mind and build the product accordingly. While doing that, you also need to look at the bigger picture of what the company is trying to achieve through that product. I witnessed all of this firsthand while working on every project at FB and now at Intuit as well.

**SM**: I’m sure working on such large projects would require plenty of tools too, right? What are some of the tools you use to be an effective PM?

**NS**: Honestly, the answer might surprise you a bit, but the best tool for any PM is Google Docs. Any tool that you can get your team to work and collaborate on together is the best tool. Be it Slack, be it FB Workplace, just anything that your team is comfortable using and enhances effective communication among teammates. Personally, I like Google Docs because I can jot down ideas, PRDs, feedbacks, etc., and share them with the team instantly. I also liked FB Workplace too. It was a sort of professional Facebook for Facebook employees. You could literally share ideas with people in the whole organization and have them respond with feedback on your ideas. Kind of like a sounding board for your ideas. When you can get instant feedback on your ideas by your teammates and some of the smartest people in the world, there’s nothing like it.

At Intuit, I currently use JIRA and Slack on a daily basis. Both of these tools are great for communication and road-mapping, and as I said, my team works effectively with these tools, so why not!

**SM**: What about failures? Were there any days where you felt like you messed up or didn’t perform your best?

**NS**: er… not really. I can’t seem to recall a specific instance where we failed massively, or something didn’t go according to plan. However, there was this last project that I worked on that really frustrated the whole team because it took really long to get it right. The project involved implementing machine learning to a product we were building but every time we ran tests we would keep getting absurd results, so it took a long time to get it working. Apart from that, I can’t remember any failures right now.

I would say this though, there are some lessons I learned at Facebook:-

1. I wish I’d learned to leverage the vast network of people that Facebook provides. I think I missed out on meeting a lot of really smart people that were present at Facebook. So yeah, networking for sure.
2. I wish I’d developed a stronger passion for social media. I look at the vast amount of opportunities that are currently present in the social media space and I go, ‘I wish I’d built that’. It’s amazing to see how this field is growing multiple-folds on a day-to-day basis and how a lot of companies are solving unique problems.
3. I wish I’d started to get motivated by problems more often. In the sense that, I would look at a problem and get excited by it. It helped do my job better. No matter what the problem, if you’re not excited to solve it, you’ll do a mediocre job at best.
So yeah those are my 3 takeaways from my time at Facebook.

**SM**: So after all this time in Product Management, how would you describe this field if you had to explain it to someone who has no clue about it?

**NS**: I’d say it’s like building a Lego house. You want to build a Lego house and you have all these pieces with you. As a product manager, you’re the architect who’s supposed to provide the blueprint of processes on how to build the house and how it would look like when it’s completed. Which piece goes where and the decision if it fits best or not, is also the job of that architect. In congruence, the product is the Lego house and the architect is the product manager. As a product manager, you want to make sure that everybody on your team is on the same page and are striving to build the house as you imagined it.

**SM**: Any advice for students?

**NS**: Build and fail. There’s not a better joy in building things and there’s not a better teacher than failure. When you’re building something, be obsessed with the problem you’re solving, get motivated to build solutions. Dream of them! In the end, when you’ve built something, the satisfaction of building it will be worth it. Along the process, you’d fail multiple times, but what matters is not giving up the project. You take your lessons from that failure and improvise. I think I developed that during my drone-building days and it has helped in my career so far.

**SM**: Alright. I’m done with Product Management questions. Now onto personal questions, what’s a book you cherish?

**NS**: So one of my managers at Facebook gave me this book when I told him I was having difficulties in communicating my ideas. It’s called Writing that Matters. I don’t know who it’s written by, but it was a great book to learn how to write. It helped me a lot in my writing. Brevity is the soul of the wit. It reminds me of a quote that goes “I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.” It’s an underrated superpower to put ideas across in a clear and concise manner.

**SM**: Your all-time favorite movie?

**NS**: Apollo 13. “Failure is not an option.” What a movie!

**SM**: Any place you’d like to travel?

**NS**: Can I say the International Space Station? Because I really wish to see space and Earth from space.

**SM**: Yeah. When Elon Musk solves space travel. But any other place on Earth?

**NS**: Antarctica! I’d love to visit it once. Actually, if not Antarctica, Svalbard for sure. It’s the Northernmost point of civilization on Earth. That’d be cool place to see.

**SM**: Alright! We’ve reached the end of this long call. This was one of the most insightful calls I’ve had with a product manager. Thank you so much for speaking with me. I appreciate it so so much. If I can ever be of help to you anytime, please don’t hesitate to ask.

**NS**: It was my pleasure, man. Happy to help. Bye!

**SM**: Bye!
