*Imagine you’re in your last year of undergrad and placement season is in full swing. Suddenly you get the news that the Placement co-ordinator has passed away and to make matters worse, the recession has hit the markets. Uncertainty and panic on the face of every person you meet. So this person I interviewed last week rounded up a bunch of friends and took control of the placement cell. He made sure that the companies came and the recruitment processes were carried out smoothly. All because he wanted to help every student get what they deserved. He saw a problem, he acted on it.*

[Sayantan Mukhopadhyay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayantanmukhopadhyay/) is currently the Lead Product Manager for Pinterest Ads Quality. Formerly Sayantan was a Product Manager for Twitter Core Ads team focusing on user modeling, marketplace, and ad serving. He also built and led the Analytics and Internal Tools team within the COO org at Twitter, San Francisco for 2+ years. Last week I spoke to Sayantan about his experiences in the field of Product Management. Here are a few key takeaways from it:

## On College life

I took up Computer Science Engineering after high school because that’s what the bank provided loans for, however, I did end up taking an economics course, something I am always passionate about, at an open university while studying engineering. In college, I was actively involved in a non-profit organization, I was a local correspondent for two newspapers, and I served as the editor for  the college magazine.

After working for Accenture in India and Singapore for three years I started my Master’s at UC Berkeley. At the time, I had no idea what Silicon Valley was, or what Bay Area meant. I had literally just packed my bags and arrived in the US, just excited to learn at my dream school. I got into an amazing interdisciplinary program and I was eager to start. In my first year, I was kind of all over the place. I worked as a Research assistant, took on a lot of courses, and just worked my butt off. The second year is when I started focusing on what I want to do and how I can get there. I was primarily interested in two fields back then. First, Analytics and Decision Making — because it was something I was really passionate about. Second, I don’t think it was product management, but I just wanted to work in a position where I could own a problem and solve it, which is exactly what Product Management is today.

Advice for anybody applying for Masters: if you don’t get into one of the great universities, try for relatively smaller universities and learn about the professors and the researchers teaching there and fields they are interested in. It will give you an idea about where exactly you want to study.

## On Career

Back in India, all I knew was I didn’t want to end up in IT services. In my junior year, I interned at Cognizant where I learned that these IT services have very smart people building solutions for problems that they don’t own. The problems are given to them by their client without any context of what they’re trying to achieve. I just didn’t understand the ‘why’ of the problem I was trying to solve. I realized then that I didn’t enjoy working in the IT sector.

When I got my first job at Accenture in 2008, the recession hit the market. None of us had a clue what our joining dates were at the companies we had accepted an offer. We waited for months to join. Finally, in 2009, I joined Accenture and after working in India for two years, I was relocated to Singapore. There, I worked in the most diverse team of my life. The team had people from Brazil, the UK, Korea, Australia, Philippines, Malaysia, and a couple of Indians. It was really fun to learn how these people worked, thought about problems and their solutions. This was a different learning experience altogether.

After my Master’s, I joined Twitter in 2014 as an Analyst/Data Scientist. I did have a few other offers but I felt this was the best option of the lot. Not only because Twitter as a product is interesting or it was a big company, but the team I was going to work with primarily worked on financial modeling and business intelligence. They had multiple interesting problems from the revenue perspective like yield management, supply-demand, pricing, etc which excited me. It was loosely defined to what this team exactly does which basically meant that there was an opportunity for me to work on different problems. Also, I really enjoyed working with my hiring manager [Paul Kesserwani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulkesserwani/). He now runs his own FinTech startup, [cushion.ai](https://cushion.ai/), which is doing great. My career at Twitter eventually evolved into a product manager role. It’s like Twitter is my home where I grew up to learn the ways of professional life. 

Sometime around 2018, the Pinterest opportunity came organically. I was content working at Twitter. This was an opportunity that I was just curious to explore what it’s about. My idea was this is a function I’m already working in so I’d like to go and see what they are doing and whether I can bring back some of it in my work. That’s how the conversation started. I really enjoyed that conversation with [Frank Fumarola](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisfumarola/) and [Omar Seyal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarseyal/) then and here I am. But leaving Twitter was a hard decision but I wanted to challenge myself further. Pinterest as a product has lots of interesting challenges to solve and a lot of room to grow. The coordination between organic and the ad teams here is really strong which is another thing I appreciate. It’s been one and a half years, I still enjoy everything I do.

## On Transition into Product Management

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/posts/The Problem Solver/talking 2.gif" caption="credits: giphy" %}

After roughly 6 months of me joining Twitter, Paul moved to the product manager role for a different team. We then decided to build a dedicated analytics team for the revenue org. Over time, I got the opportunity to lead the team and as I got to lead the team we eventually expanded to build an internal tools team. This team was generating insights for what to do for an account or for a business on the system. To make it actionable and repeatable, we wanted to put them in different workflows where people could use it on a regular basis for their operations and decision making. In addition my team was helping the product managers make their decisions from an analytics perspective. We were building internal products but we did not have a dedicated product manager so I was doing that unknowingly. Initially, I never gave PM a serious thought, it had crossed my mind once or twice but was never serious about it. After a point of time, I was approached by the product team asking if it’s something I’d be interested in and this is when I thought it might be a good time to explore the option of PM. I was actually doing fine in my career, managing two teams of 8-9 people and scaling it. I spent some time thinking about it and I realized a couple of things: 

I was getting comfortable in my job — not a good place to be in.

Accountability and ownership — as a Product Manager you get to be accountable for the product you build and the problems you solve.

Therefore, I made the transition to a PM role at Twitter. During the course of this role, I shipped a bunch of products, led GDPR for Twitter Ads with 30+ engineers. It was a substantial effort by many cross-functional teams consisting of legal, policy, etc. collaborating on a super complex problem. I really learned a lot about being a PM at Twitter.

## On Skills for PM

These are some of the few skills that I’ve noticed in great PMs and anyone who wants to become a good PM should try to hone these early in their career:-

1. The habit of thinking in first principles

The ability to start any decision-making process answering the ‘Why’. Why does someone like the product? Why is that an important feature? The idea of breaking complex problems into smaller, simpler problems is what I believe will help you serve well as a PM.

2. Be a good listener and empathize

Try to be a good listener and understand the reasoning of others that you work with and customers you serve. When you empathize with your stakeholders and users, you will make everyone’s job a lot easier.

3. Be creative and lead the solution

Think of creative solutions. There is a textbook way to solve a problem and there’s an unorthodox way to solve a problem. While the end results could be similar in both the ways, you would have explored a different path to reach the result. What matters is you have it in you to lead the team with that creative solution and help them trust the process.

## On tools for PM

There are only three types of tools that a PM needs to be good with, doesn’t matter what software you choose:-

1. Data Tools —To be able to write SQL queries, work with Excel, define good and bad metrics. 

2. Design Tools — To be able to mock up something, and understand design principles behind some of the decisions.

3. Presentation and Writing tools — To help you effectively communicate with stakeholders and teams.

I don’t mention tools like JIRA, Trello, etc. because they are company-dependent tools and can be learned on the job. 

## On Rejections

Everyone goes through rejections in life. I’ve been through multiple rejections in my life. It’s a process of becoming an adult to learn how to deal with rejections.I find that the best way to deal with them is to lessen your expectations. Give yourself some time before you start thinking about rejections. Personally, I’ve started going to the gym regularly because even if it’s a bad day where things at work didn’t go according to my plan, at least I would have still accomplished one thing in my day. 

Breathe! In moments of difficulties, just breathe. Deep breaths help. Count your breaths as you inhale and exhale, this process calms you down. You’re going to be okay. I know it’s a cliche but it’s true. Do what gives you joy in life. Find what you like doing other than your work and commit some time to it in your week. At the end of the day, your work is not your life. You have to keep improving yourself as a person too.

*Huge thanks to Sayantan for taking the time out to speak to me. It is always a pleasure talking to him about everything under the sun. I learned so much about Product Management from his experiences at such esteemed organizations. He's one of those people I'll always find in my corner when I look for advice on my career.*

That's all, folks!

**Bonus**: An interview Garry Tan, Managing Partner at Initialized Capital, did with Ammon Bartram where Ammon discussed the rejections he's faced and how he got started in his career. Best 15 minutes you'll spend if you're hustling through rejections and looking for a dose of motivation.

If anyone reading this is still amused by whatever it is I'm doing: let's chat movies, books, or Product Management. Email, DM, or send a pigeon. Everything works.

Also, not to forget, I'm in SF from 28th Feb to 5th March and would love to meet people there. (Not that I'm an influencer or anything, I am just trying to get over my crippling social anxiety of meeting people and talking about a bunch of random stuff. )

Till next week!

Ciao! :)
